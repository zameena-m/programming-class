The Box Model
Definition
Think of each element on your page as a box. The box model outlines the structure of each box or HTML element on your page, and various components available to you.
Example

Padding
The padding is the space between the content of your box and the border.
Margin
The margin is the space between the border and the content around the box.
Border
The border is the containing walls of the box.
CSS vs. IE
The original IE box model calculated the width property of an element by including both padding and the border. The CSS box model, which came into favor, calculates the width of the content only. However, this can be frustrating, so CSS introduced a property called box-sizing that allows you to revert to the IE model by defining box-sizing: border-box;
