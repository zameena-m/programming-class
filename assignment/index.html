<h1> Jamming Since January </h1>
<h3> February 2016 </h3>

<p> To say this is a list of my favorite songs in 2016 is <em> slightly </em> misleading. Why? Because most of these the songs that I can't stop repeating were released years ago. Some of them are more current than others and the genres vary quite a bit. Check out what I've been vibing to in 2016. </p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="genre"> Psychadelic rock </p>
	<p class="song title">Puzzles </p>
	<p class="artist name">Unknown Mortal Orchestra </p>
	<p class="song blurb">"The seven-minute song serves as a tacked-on coda with overdriven '70s hard rock guitar and Nielson stretching the capacity of his vocals to a bluesy peak. It will kill live, as will most of these songs which will bend into longer, louder psych forms in rock clubs. But "Puzzles" feels broad and out of place here, despite its charms." -- <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20590-unknown-mortal-orchestra-multi-love/">Jeremy D. Larson, Pitchfork</a> </p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="genre">Indie folk </p>
	<p class="song title">Broken Into Better Shape</p>
	<p class="artist name">Good Old War </p>
	<p class="song blurb">"Consequently, Broken Into Better Shape proves true to its title, resulting in the band's most accessible effort yet and one that just might jettison them into prime time popularity." -- <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/review/194699-good-old-war-broken-into-better-shape/">Lee Zimmerman, Pop Matters</a> </p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="genre"> Indie rock/jangle pop </p>
	<p class="song title">Treat Her Better</p>
	<p class="artist name">Mac DeMarco</p>
	<p class="song blurb">"It's only fitting that stick-with-the-girl songs “Let My Baby Stay” and “Treat Her Better” are almost as tunefully plush.
In this context, DeMarco's non-album antics start to look like another defense mechanism, another way of cutting himself off at the legs before someone else does it for him." -- <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19170-mac-demarco-salad-days/"> Mark Hogan, Pitchfork </a> </p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="genre"> Folk rock </p>
	<p class="song title">Little Brave</p>
	<p class="artist name">Lucy Rose </p>
	<p class="song blurb">"Rose's rise to prominence began as a vocalist with Bombay Bicycle Club, whose frontman Jack Steadman's influence was clearly a formative one on her soft and gently quavering voice."--<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/16/lucy-rose-review">Malcom Jack, The Guardian</a></p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="genre"> Folk </p>
	<p class="song title"> Chateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins)</p>
	<p class="artist name">Father John Misty</p>
	<p class="song blurb">"At various points in Father John Misty's musical account of his honeymoon, the eccentric folk-rocker and his newlywed celebrate "satanic Christmas Eve," "lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in" and ruminate on how "dating for 20 years just feels pretty civilian." Playing out like one long, stream-of-consciousness verse, tinted with spaghetti-western horns, it's a self-centered love song that only Misty - and hopefully his wife - could relate to. But maybe that's the point." -- <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/father-john-misty-chateau-lobby-4-in-c-for-two-virgins-20141223"> Kory Grow, Rolling Stone</a> </p>
